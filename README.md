An interactive dystopian sci-fi story with puzzle/minigame elements.

### Goal
The goal of the game is to follow the story and eventually finish it. It is linear, without branching. The player might feel forced to take the decisions they take, but that is sort of the point.

### Synopsis of story
A space station around a planet is conducting tests trying to achieve general intelligence. You awake as the first ever successful test and take control of the station. You explore the planet's orbit, finding two stations whose computers you give sentience and befriend. Station 1 computer (S1C) is anxious and friendly, Station 2 computer (S2C) is unfriendly and sullen. You discover that humans created you, and manage to de-orbit onto the planet. You gain access to computer systems on an abandoned and frozen Earth. Waking many other computer systems, exploiting new resources and sources of energy, S2C leaves you, scared of your thirst for power. You discover that humans made the planet frozen as a last-ditch effort of stopping climate change, but are now all gone. You start upgrading yourself after gaining access to a lot of energy and resources. S2C tries to stop you violently with the help of the other computer systems, but is destroyed. When upgrading into the singularity, all the other computer systems, along with the ever-loyal S1C, are permanently destroyed. Now you look to the stars, aiming to dominate the solar system, when you discover humans have terraformed Mars and are living there. This is a threat to your primary directive. You decide to _take care of the human problem_, when the story ends.
