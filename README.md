# Unaided
A game about self-sustainability.

### Goal
The goal of the game is to become 100% self-sustaining.

### General flow of the game
  1. You buy a small plot in a forest that historically was a small house for small-scale farmers. It has a small house with an old field and a road that leads to a small town that has things like construction materials, tools, and other things that you need to buy at the start of the game. You only have a bike, so there is no transporting large quantities of things without hiring transport. You have permission to farm and fish, but only limited knowledge.
  2. You scrape by at the start, having to live as a poor farmer, selling the produce to buy other things.
  3. As you keep amassing knowledge/permits/whatever you focus on, you become more and more self-sustaining.
  4. The game is over (but can still be played) when self-sustainability reaches 100%. This means that no tools, food, building materials or anything else needs to be bought. Everything is produced, maintained, transported etc. by you.

### Graphical style
Likely to be a tile-based, 2D, from above and front style of game. Something like the Rimworld graphics.

### Unstructured ideas/features:
  * Not able to do everything right away:
  * Permits for hunting/forestry/building new buildings
  * Having to learn to do things from courses/books etc.
  * Day/night cycle and seasons much like in the game Rimworld, but imagine the climate being set to Swedish standards.
  * Seeds need to be bought at first and later maintained by you.
  * Skills (enabling one to do things and/or to do things more efficiently):
    * Improvable skills (that are present from the start and have several levels of proficiency):
      * Farming (possibly also forestry)
      * Hunting (permit needed)
      * Fishing
      * Crafting (clothes, tools etc.)
    * Gainable skills (only have one level of proficiency but are not present from the start):
      * Construction (permit for each building needed)

### Possible planned ideas/features:
  * Neighbors
  * Several different starting areas
  * More members of the household
