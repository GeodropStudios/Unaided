An interactive dystopian sci-fi story with puzzle/minigame elements.

### Goal
The goal of the game is to follow the story and eventually finish it. It is linear, without branching. The player might feel forced to take the decisions they take, but that is sort of the point.

### Synopsis of story
To be written.

### Main gameplay elements:
Smaller minigame-style challenges that change continually throughout your journey.

### Graphical style
Low poly 3D graphics with desaturated colors and realistic lighting.


## TODO:
- Write story synopsis.
- Prototype gameplay ideas.
- Make concept art.
- Refine S1C and S2C character motivations according to writing theory.
