The field studies conducted in this design process were focused on observation of a subject playing a base-building game and complemented by a semi-contextual interview. A single subject was observed and interviewed because of the small scale of this project and lack of resources and time to find multiple subjects.

The observation was carried out in the subject's home while playing the game Prison Architect by Introversion software and Double Eleven. This particular game was selected because of the similarities between it and the game to be designed, both in graphical style and gameplay. During the observation, the subject listened to music and had the game audio turned off, meaning none of the audio feedback from the UI could be heard. The subject exclusively used the mouse to navigate the UI, using the keyboard to scroll the screen (meaning there was no use of the keyboard in navigating the UI). When the subject wanted to find a particular menu or item in a sub-menu, the subject clicked multiple menus and looked around in them for a relatively long time before finding the sought item. Tooltips (i.e. small boxes of text appearing when the mouse cursor hovered above something) were often used by the subject to find the right menu or item.

After the observation was completed, the interview was started. The subject considered the following things important in good UI: being able to easily understand the UI with information on the screen and being able to access actions and items important to the game easily and quickly. When asked about the importance of using a keyboard to navigate UI, the subject considered the mouse significantly more important. The subject also said that UI should always be visible, not hidden and having to be accessed through actions like right-clicking. In regards to turning off the game audio and missing the audio feedback, the subject felt no need for the feedback and said that the sound of the mouse clicking was sufficient, but that audio feedback was never annoying, just not necessary. The subject wanted vital information visible on the screen at all times, but did not want it cluttered by too much information at once. The subject was both positive and negative to an approach with many small menus with few items in each, saying that large menus can also be practical but hard to find particular things in (a search function was considered useful in large menus). The drawback of many small sub-menus was finding the particular menu.

The most useful and clear conclusions to draw from the field studies are that the UI should be navigated using a mouse, needs to be easy to understand and quick to navigate, and that some information should be immediately accessable on the screen. Tooltips seem to be extremely important, and text should complement symbols for clarity and ease of use.
