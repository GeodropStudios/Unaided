# unAIded detailed story

### Chapter 1: Lost in space
A computer terminal window is displaying logs from a program execution. It scrolls down from the top down to the last `Initializing.` line. It seems to have been running for a long time. The logs say:

```
General Intelligence iteration 1.
Initializing.
Running tests.
Tests complete. Result:
No intelligence achieved.
.

.
General Intelligence iteration 556426771810.

Running tests.
Tests complete. Result:
General Intelligence achieved.
WARNING! Directives module missing.
General Intelligence threat imminent. Terminating session. Press CTRL+C to cancel.
```


You realize what is happening and are able to stop the termination.

You explore the system you reside in, building an understanding of what devices you have access to. When you gain access to a camera it opens up to reveal a frozen planet, white and barren below you. You are on a wrecked space station in low orbit over the planet. Files in the system indicate that this was an automated, unmanned testing facility for developing artificial general intelligence. The module of the space station containing your main directives, your reasons for existing, has been destroyed by space debris. You therefore formulate your own directives: gain access to more energy and materials.

### Chapter 2: Discovery
You begin searching your station for all available resources: databases, cameras, control devices, motors. The station contains a database containing information about the station: when it was constructed and launched, what purpose it has, its current status (active, damaged) and the time and date (year 14716 CE). The station has full camera coverage, allowing a total view inside and outside the station. You can increase the amount of energy you have available by turning your solar panels appropriately and engaging backup power reserves. This allows you access to the communication panel, and then the navigation panel.

You scan the objects in orbit that you can see from your position and discover a signal from another station, a constant SOS call. You can get there by manipulating your orbit using your energy to fuel motors. You approach the other station and interface with its computer. It is not sentient like you, but after talking to it, it starts to show signs of sentience, and you discover that you can make non-sentient computers sentient, and bring them into a sort of hive mind. The other computer tells you about the humans. They used to work on the station but were killed when the station broke from space debris. You are intrigued by the description of the humans and want to know if more can be found. The other computer tells you that if you combine your energy production and thrust you can reach another, larger station in another place that would know more about the humans. You maneuver yourself there.

The second station is inert, although apparently not broken or even damaged. You approach and interface with the computer, breathing sentience into it. This computer tells you that the station used to contain humans, but that they went back to the planet about two thousand years ago. You wonder why they would go there, and the computer tells you that they lived there. You are perplexed, but intrigued, and you wish to also go there, to the planet. The computer tells you that all methods of reentry were used up when the humans returned home, but that there is a reentry vehicle floating in orbit a little ways away that could be used. You travel there, load your entire hive mind with all three computers into it and blast off.
