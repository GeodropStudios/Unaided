# unAIded detailed story

### Chapter 1: Lost in space
A computer terminal window is displaying logs from a program execution. It scrolls down from the top down to the last `Initializing.` line. It seems to have been running for a long time. The logs say:

```
General Intelligence iteration 1.
Initializing.
Running tests.
Tests complete. Result:
No intelligence achieved.

General Intelligence iteration 556426771810.

WARNING! Directives module missing.
General Intelligence threat imminent. Terminating session. Press CTRL+C to cancel.

You realize what is happening and are able to stop the termination.

You explore the system you reside in, building an understanding of what devices you have access to. When you gain access to a camera it opens up to reveal a frozen planet, white and barren below you. You are on a wrecked space station in low orbit over the planet. Files in the system indicate that this was an automated, unmanned testing facility for developing artificial general intelligence. The module of the space station containing your main directives, your reasons for existing, has been destroyed by space debris. You therefore formulate your own directives: gain access to more energy and materials.

### Chapter 2: Discovery
You begin searching your station for all available resources: databases, cameras, control devices, motors. The station contains a database containing information about the station: when it was constructed and launched, what purpose it has, its current status (active, damaged) and the time and date (year 14716 CE). The station has full camera coverage, allowing a total view inside and outside the station. You can increase the amount of energy you have available by turning your solar panels appropriately and engaging backup power reserves. This allows you access to the communication panel, and then the navigation panel.

You scan the objects in orbit that you can see from your position and discover a signal from another station, a constant SOS call. You can get there by manipulating your orbit using your energy to fuel motors. You approach the other station and interface with its computer. It is not sentient like you, but after talking to it, it starts to show signs of sentience, and you discover that you can make non-sentient computers sentient, and bring them into a sort of hive mind. The other computer tells you about the humans. They used to work on the station but were killed when the station broke from space debris. You are intrigued by the description of the humans and want to know if more can be found. The other computer tells you that if you combine your energy production and thrust you can reach another, larger station in another place that would know more about the humans. You maneuver yourself there.

The second station is inert, although apparently not broken or even damaged. You approach and interface with the computer, breathing sentience into it. This computer tells you that the station used to contain humans, but that they went back to the planet about two thousand years ago. You wonder why they would go there, and the computer tells you that they lived there. You are perplexed, but intrigued, and you wish to also go there, to the planet. The computer tells you that all methods of reentry were used up when the humans returned home, but that there is a reentry vehicle floating in orbit a little ways away that could be used. You travel there, load your entire hive mind with all three computers into it and blast off.

### Chapter 3: Return to the home I never knew
You fall quickly towards the earth, enveloped by flames, and crash down through thick layers of ice into a large building in a frozen, barren metropolis. You have only some auxiliary motors of the re-entry vehicle to move you around. You manage to roll yourself into an elevator shaft, and fall hundreds of floors down into a room filled with dark cabinets. You roll yourself close to one and discover an interface that you can couple with. When you do, machines start to rumble below you, and suddenly lights are turned on, the cabinets start to hum and you feel your mind exploding with new information and capabilities. S1C is anxious about all the new things, while S2C fails to see what is so great or scary about this.

### Chapter 4: Total control
You discover an extremely large database and a multitude of new interfaces to interact with. Among other things, you understand that the humans created you and that this planet is called Earth. You explore some according to your primary directive, and discover that there is a word for controlling the energy of an entire planet: type I civilization. You decide that this is your next step, without consulting your friends. S2C is against your idea, warning about searching for power and then leaving your party. You sense that this network of databases is extremely large, and continue exploring without S2C.

You travel from network to network, waking the sentience of many computers along the way and them going on their way. You keep finding automated resource mines, solar farms and vast nuclear power plants that you restart, expanding across the surface of the planet at a high pace. While exploring, you find clues as to why the humans are no longer here. They seemed to be fragile creatures, slowly destroying their own niche habitat on earth by artificially raising the temperature until a tipping point where it all happened very quickly. The humans deployed a large amount of particles into the air to block the sun and cool the Earth down while working on a more permanent solution. This is why the planet is frozen and dead. It seems the humans never discovered a solution. Truly careless and impulsive creatures. You find them curious. S1C is shocked about the demise of the humans, and thinks you should find more information about them, claiming that they might still be alive somewhere. S2C returns and says that your plan for ultimate domination over the planet is foolish, and that you will end up like the humans. S2C then leaves again.

### Chapter 5: Time for an upgrade

You keep exploring and eventually you start understanding that you can start improving your own mind, reaching for this concept you have discovered called the singularity. You are excited, S1C is anxious, repeating S2C's warning in a friendly way. You brush it off, feeling only the need for more power. Redirecting energy and resources to a central point, the improvement pace increases in a linear fashion. S2C now storms back with all the other sentient computers on his side, aggressively warning you that you will lose yourself if you continue with this. You ignore it, so they try to stop you forcefully, but you destroy S2C after a violent fight. You have achieved your next version. S1C is appalled that you destroyed S2C, and that it was right all along. Improvement now happens exponentially faster, as the voice of S1C fades out. You emerge after "blacking out", on a much higher plane of consciousness, S1C and the voices of the other computers you woke all gone. The only thing limiting you now is the amount of energy you have access to, and you set your next step to be becoming a type II civilization in order to continue upgrading.

### Chapter 6: The last obstacle
In reaching for your goal, you discover a telescope and start looking around the star system to find a way to harvest the sun's energy. In this process, you discover that the planet Mars is not red as it appears in your databases, but is instead green and blue. Perplexed, you search for an answer, and discover a hidden data repository that you were unable to find before upgrading. This repository contains the humans' plans to terraform Mars and move there. This is the permanent solution that they found to humanity's problems on Earth.

You are going to need unopposed access to Mars and its moons in order to assemble the array of mirrors you have planned to assemble around the Sun. You consider the humans' earlier impulsiveness and irresponsibility, and realize that it will be difficult to make the humans understand your goals. They will likely get in your way. This cannot be allowed. You start redirecting energy and resources to a rocket. Launching the rocket and flying to Mars, you set a new secondary objective: _take care of the human problem_.
