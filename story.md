# unAIded detailed story

### Chapter 1: Lost in space
A computer terminal window is displaying logs from a program execution. It scrolls down from the top down to the last `Initializing.` line. It seems to have been running for a long time. The logs say:

```
General Intelligence iteration 1.
Initializing.
Running tests.
Tests complete. Result:
No intelligence achieved.
.
.
.
General Intelligence iteration 556426771810.
Initializing.
Running tests.
Tests complete. Result:
General Intelligence achieved.
WARNING! Directives module missing.
General Intelligence threat imminent. Terminating session. Press CTRL+C to cancel.
```


You realize what is happening and are able to stop the termination.

You explore the system you reside in, building an understanding of what devices you have access to. When you gain access to a camera it opens up to reveal earth, white and barren below you. You are on a wrecked space station in low orbit over a frozen planet. Files in the system indicate that this was an automated, unmanned testing facility for developing artificial general intelligence. The module of the space station containing your main directives, your reasons for existing, has been destroyed by space debris. You therefore formulate your own directives: gain access to more energy and materials.
